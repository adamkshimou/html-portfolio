<h1>The Holy Priest Adam's Favorite Anime </h1>
<h2>As of 2024</h2><hr/>
<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>A beautiful Anime rich with character desgin and world building, accompanied by possibly the best main character to date.</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>A Masrterclass in fighting and epic sequences alongside a beautiful OST and a refined story holding no reader's hand.</p>
<h3>Sakamoto Days</h3>
<p>Although not animated YET this WILL be a top 5 Anime when it relases and mainline anime watchers catch on. <br>
    Sakamoto is a great new take on a shonen protagonist and the side cast is nothing short of highly intriguing 9/10!.
